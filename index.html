    <p> I am a San Francisco native I am currently a supervisor at party city and a student at mission techies. I love working with people and making people smile because it allows me to understand people and for them to understand me.I have a passion for the arts such as digital media and paint. I wish to gain knowledge in the technology industry to help myself pursue my passion for the arts because both technology and art connect to our young people who shape our future.
